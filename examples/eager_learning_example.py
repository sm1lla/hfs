Eager learning
=====================

These examples show you how to use the library's hierarchical feature selection methods for eager learning.
In this example the SHSELSelector is used. However, you can replace this class with any other eager
hierarchical feature selector class and use it in exactly the same way.

# Artificial data
# ----------------
# This is just a simple example using artificial data to show you how the
# Selector is used. In this example only the feature selection step and no
# classification is performed.

# Example hierarchy graph : The node numbers refer to the dataset columns
graph = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (0, 4)])

# Create mapping from columns to hierarchy nodes

# Real data
# -----------
# This is an example using a real world dataset. The SportsTweets Dataset consists
# of hierarchical type features that were extracted from tweets. These tweets are
# classified as either a sports tweet or not a sports tweet. The classification step
# is performed with a Naive Bayes Classifier implemented in Scikit-learn.
